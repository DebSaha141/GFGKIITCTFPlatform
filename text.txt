Few changes to make last solve is underleadersboard is coming as inavlid date, revamp the profile and dashboard page to make it look good, on both pages under recent activities and solved challenges even though a challenge has been solved its showing NA, I believe the submission collection is not being updated. On the admin dashboard make a page which will show all the recent activities from different users like submissions. Protect those crucial routes of submissions so that people don't change their score using postman. Next I am seeing that if my website reloads I meant redeployed the start ctf button resets, so make use the mongodb to control the switch. So, that even if website crashes if the ctf has been started it should keep on going, then add a option on the admin page in adding challenges to add links to files which can be downloaded or website link to visit. Also revamp the challenges page, it looks very old school design, make it look better, give each challenge its seperate sub card, so that there are clear distinctions. Then on the admin page for every challenge add a edit option to edit the challenges. Sanitize all input fields of any mischiefs by the participants, like SQL injection or what not. Also change the way currently challenges open, details of individual challenges are being opened on a new page upon clicking, instead make it on the same page in the form of a popup. Also remove files which are not being used like files for category since I told you that it will be hardcoded. Also the drop down menu to select category on add challenge page is coming white fix that also.
